# NCRelay Feature Implementation Summary

## IP Address Whitelisting System

### Overview
The IP address whitelisting system provides endpoint-specific security controls, allowing administrators to restrict access to custom API endpoints to specific IP addresses.

### Completed Implementation

1. **Database Schema**
   - Added `ipWhitelist` column to `api_endpoints` table (migration 008)
   - JSON array storage for IP addresses with default empty array
   - Backward compatibility with existing endpoints

2. **Security Logic**
   - Enhanced `isIPAllowedForEndpoint()` utility function
   - Support for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
   - Localhost variations handling (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `localhost`)
   - Whitespace trimming and validation

3. **API Route Protection**
   - Custom endpoint route validates IP addresses before processing
   - Returns 403 Forbidden with proper logging for denied requests
   - Maintains CORS headers for error responses

4. **User Interface**
   - Created reusable `IpWhitelistManager` React component
   - Visual IP address management with badges and validation
   - Integration with API endpoints dashboard
   - Form validation and error handling

5. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Comprehensive test suite covering edge cases
   - User documentation with examples and troubleshooting
   - Security considerations and best practices

## Field Filter System

### Overview
The field filter system provides a simpler and more intuitive alternative to Grok patterns for extracting and filtering fields from N-central XML notifications.

### Completed Implementation

1. **Data Model and Database**
   - Created `FieldFilterConfig` interface to define field filter structure
   - Added `fieldFilterId` field to Integration interface
   - Implemented database schema migration for field filters
   - Created CRUD operations for field filter management

2. **Field Processing**
   - Implemented XML field extraction and flattening
   - Created filtering logic based on include/exclude rules
   - Maintained backward compatibility with Grok patterns
   - Added processing fallbacks for error cases

3. **UI Components**
   - Created field filter creation page with XML sample upload
   - Implemented field selection interface with checkboxes
   - Built filter management dashboard for listing and editing filters
   - Added field filter selection to integration forms

4. **API Endpoints**
   - Implemented field extraction test endpoint
   - Created server actions for field filter operations
   - Added integration with the notification processing pipeline

5. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive documentation for field filters
   - Provided migration guide for users with existing Grok patterns

## Grok Pattern Extraction Feature

### Completed Implementation

1. **Route Handler Integration**
   - Modified the custom endpoint route handler to process incoming payloads using grok patterns
   - Added functionality to fetch grok patterns and template mappings
   - Implemented conditional logic to use patterns when configured
   - Provided fallback to default processing when pattern processing fails

2. **Database Integration**
   - Added function to get integrations using a specific pattern
   - Implemented proper error handling in database operations

3. **UI Enhancements**
   - Added "Used By" tab to the pattern details page
   - Implemented UI to display integrations using a specific pattern
   - Created a clear user flow for pattern creation, testing, and management

4. **Testing**
   - Created comprehensive unit tests for the grok pattern processing functions
   - Tested extraction, template application, and message processing

5. **Documentation**
   - Created detailed documentation on using grok patterns
   - Provided examples of patterns and templates
   - Documented the available pattern types and usage scenarios

## Feature Summary

The Grok Pattern Extraction feature allows NCRelay users to:

1. **Create and Manage Patterns**
   - Define patterns using a simplified grok syntax
   - Test patterns against sample data
   - View extracted variables in real-time

2. **Create Platform-Specific Templates**
   - Define how extracted data should be formatted for different platforms
   - Use variables from patterns in templates with `{variable_name}` syntax
   - Create multiple templates for each platform

3. **Use Patterns with Integrations**
   - Associate patterns with integrations
   - See which integrations are using each pattern
   - Apply platform-specific formatting to extracted data

4. **Process Incoming Payloads**
   - Extract specific data using patterns
   - Apply templates based on the destination platform
   - Fall back to default processing if pattern extraction fails

## Possible Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Pattern Library**
   - Add more built-in pattern types
   - Support for custom pattern definitions

2. **Conditional Processing**
   - Apply different templates based on extracted values
   - Support for conditional logic in templates

3. **Template Variables**
   - Support for default values in templates
   - Value transformations (uppercase, lowercase, etc.)

4. **Pattern Sharing**
   - Export/import patterns and templates
   - Public pattern library
